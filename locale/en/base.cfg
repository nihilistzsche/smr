smr=SMRs

[mod-description]
smr=Small modular nuclear reactors designed to be deployed off-grid at remote sites. SMRs are manufactured as sealed units with a fixed energy capacity, including both fuel and generator components. This means they can be quickly setup anywhere but once depleted must be returned to base for refurbishment.
